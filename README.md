# Capitalization

Use sentence casing (first letter of first word is capitalized, the rest all lowercase) for all UI elements, including buttons, page titles, control labels etc. 

###### You should always capitalize:
* The first word of a new sentence
* The word following a colon in a title or heading.  
Example: "Step 1: Begin by entering your account info"
Proper nouns, names of people, cities etc.
